### Pattern template

A variety of formal processes should be grouped in clusters to enhance interlinking informal processes that ensure a balanced context for both within each cluster.

**Physical** Workplaces for a variety of employments should be clustered in groups of 10 to 20 around their own courtyards to form an identifiable work community with some collective amenities and nested within a larger community with other services. The work community then provides for a more balanced life outside the house.

**Social** Groups or task forces with a variety of preoccupations should be encouraged to form into clusters of 10 to 20 such as to reinforce the informal interaction amongst them. The resulting community or network then provides for a healthier degree of functional balance than is normally possible outside non-directive groups.

**Conceptual** Utilization of a variety of distinct methodologies or conceptual frameworks should be organized into clusters of 10 to 20 such as to reinforce the processes of non- formal interaction amongst them. The resulting network or "invisible college" then provides for a healthier degree of conceptual balance than is normally possible outside contexts of non-deterministic reflection.

**Psychic** A variety of distinct perceptual frameworks should be grouped into clusters of 10 to 20 such as to reinforce the processes of unconscious integration amongst them. The resulting gestalt then provides for a more balanced mode of awareness than is normally possible in the absence of "seedless" meditation.

**Broader** [Interchange](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1034.php); [Activity nodes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1030.php); [Functional cycle](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1026.php); [Context boundary](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1015.php); [Sub-domain boundary](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1013.php); [Identifiable context](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1014.php); [Decentralized formal processes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1009.php); [Adequate variety of cyclic elements](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1035.php).
