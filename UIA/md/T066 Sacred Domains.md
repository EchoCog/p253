### Pattern template

Sacred Domains provide essential structural and functional elements that support the healthy development and maintenance of complex systems.

**Physical** Sacred spaces that provide spiritual connection should be protected and maintained as special places within communities.

**Social** Spaces that embody core organizational values should be protected and celebrated as sacred to the community.

**Conceptual** Foundational concepts that anchor understanding should be preserved and honored as sacred knowledge.

**Psychic** Sacred aspects of inner experience should be honored and protected as essential to well-being.

**Broader:**
