### Pattern template

Zones of fundamental transformations should be situated in chains such as to form boundaries within a domain rather than being isolated within a specialized domain.

**Physical** Industry should be distributed along ribbons such as to form boundaries between communities rather than being completely separated from urban life and thus contributing to the unreality of sheltered residential neighbourhoods and to the sterility of industrial parks.

**Social** Managerial and administrative action groups should be situated such as to form boundaries between organizational complexes, rather than being grouped separately from working operations, thus contributing to the unreality of sheltered working environments and to the sterility of bureaucracy.

**Conceptual** Application of theory to concrete problems should be linked such as to form boundaries between conceptual frameworks, rather than being isolated from areas of purely theoretical work, thus contributing to the unreality of such sheltered research environments and to appreciations based on limited insights.

**Psychic** Adaptations and use of modes of awareness in real-world situations should be linked such as to form boundaries between fields of awareness, rather than being completely isolated from reflection and meditation and thus contributing to the unreality of such protected activities and to unenlightened action.

**Broader** [Encirclement](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1017.php); [Sub-domain boundary](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1013.php); [Decentralized formal processes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1009.php); [Informal context for formal processes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1041.php).

**Narrower** [Integrated contexts for perspective dynamics](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1080.php); [Direct relationship between structures and communication pathways](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1122.php); [Functional enhancement of domains separating complementary structures](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1106.php).
