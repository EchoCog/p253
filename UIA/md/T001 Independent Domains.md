### Pattern template

Balance between domains will not be achieved unless each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of influence.

**Physical** Metropolitan regions will not come to balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of influence. Whenever possible, evolution of such regions should be encouraged; each with its own natural and geographic boundaries; each with its own economy; each one autonomous and self-governing.

**Social** Major networks or communities of organizations will not come to functional balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of influence.

**Conceptual** Major paradigms, networks of concepts or schools of thought will not come to functional balance until each one is sufficiently well-defined and autonomous to be an independent sphere of insight.

**Psychic** Major modes of awareness will not come to functional balance within the individual until each one is sufficiently well-defined and autonomous to be an independent sphere of influence.

**Narrower:**
