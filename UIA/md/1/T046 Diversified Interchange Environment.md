### Pattern template

For an interchange environment to be most effective it should be highly diversified within a framework providing the minimum coherence for the variety of styles and modes of operation.

**Physical** A market is most effective and dynamic when it offers a wide variety of products through many shops, each organized according to its own style rather than standardized within a monolithic supermarket. Only a minimum structure of roofing, aisles and common services is required.

**Social** A meeting environment is most effective and dynamic when it offers a wide variety of experiences each organized according to its particular style rather than according to a uniform set of procedures. Only a minimum framework defining and interrelating meeting spaces and common services is required.

**Conceptual** A framework for the interchange of ideas is most effective and dynamic when it offers a wide variety of methods, approaches and procedures, rather than being based on a single all-embracing approach. Only a minimum framework defining the relationship between the approaches is required, together with any common facilitative procedures.

**Psychic** A mode of awareness ensuring cross- fertilization between perceptions is most effective and significant when it permits a wide variety of perceptions rather than being based on one all-embracing mode of comprehension. Only a minimum comprehension framework is required to clarify the relationship between the different perceptions.

**Broader** [Selective interchange axis](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1032.php); [Web of selective interchange](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1019.php).

**Narrower** [Flexible interfaces](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1244.php); [Local sources for perspective nourishment](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1089.php); [Protected low-density communication pathways](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1101.php); [Exchange contexts controlled by a single perspective](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1087.php); [Arrangement of structures ot engender fruitful interfaces](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1100.php); [Exposure of structural activities to communication pathway](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1165.php); [Primary inter-level connections at transitions in boundary orientation](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1212.php).
