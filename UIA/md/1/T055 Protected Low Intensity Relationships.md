### Pattern template

In order to prevent high intensity relationships from acquiring disproportionate significance, low intensity relationships should be given a prominent position, especially where they have a common boundary with those of high intensity.

**Physical** Pedestrian sidewalks should be raised 0.5 metres above the level of parallel roads carrying fast-moving traffic, with some form of railing to mark the edge, or else pedestrians feel overwhelmed by the vehicles.

**Broader** [Compensating relationships in parallel](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1023.php); [Differentiation by relationship density](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1036.php); [Intersection of differently paced communications](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1054.php); [Interfacing vehicles of communication and networks of unmediated relationships](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1052.php).

**Narrower** [Ambiguous boundaries](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1243.php); [Partially contained interfaces](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1119.php); [Hospitability of communication pathways](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1121.php); [Integrating points of perspective into common domains](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1125.php); [Arrangement of structures ot engender fruitful interfaces](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1100.php); [Transit point location for sources of perspective nourishment](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1093.php).
