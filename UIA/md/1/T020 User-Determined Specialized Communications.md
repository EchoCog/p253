### Pattern template

Relationships should be such as to permit contact in an environment between any point and any other point.

**Physical** Public transportation should be such as to take people from any point to any other point within a metropolitan area. This can be accomplished by supplementing high-volume transportation with a mini-bus feeder service over a varying route optimized by computer in response to requirements of individual users.

**Social** Communications within a society or an organizational complex should be such as to permit any person to make contact with any other person or group within that community. Computer assistance should be available to enable a person to discover the communications address of the contact appropriate to his needs.

**Conceptual** Relationships within a knowledge- representative system should be such as to permit the relevance of any concept to any other concept to be established, particularly when such a system is computer-enhanced.

**Psychic** Associative relationships within any mode of awareness should be such as to enable any perception to enhance any other perception, possibly with the aid of metaphoric transpositions of perspective.

**Broader** [Local interrelationship domains](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1011.php); [Web of general interrelationships](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1016.php).

**Narrower** [Interchange](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1034.php); [Hospitable transit points](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1092.php); [Compensating relationships in parallel](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1023.php)
