### Pattern template

Wherever a network of lower intensity relationships is exposed to one of higher intensity, the intersection should be designed such as to protect the integrity of the latter.

**Physical** Where pedestrian pathways cross roads, the crossing should be protected by, for example, providing islands between the lanes and ensuring its recognition by drivers.

**Broader** [Selective interchange axis](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1032.php); [Compensating relationships in parallel](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1023.php); [Interfacing vehicles of communication and networks of unmediated relationships](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1052.php).

**Narrower** [Flexible interfaces](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1244.php); [Hospitable transit points](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1092.php); [Protected low intensity relationships](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1055.php); [Bounded common small-scale interaction domains](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1061.php); [Communication pathways enfolded by non-linearity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1174.php); [Limitation on number of occupiable temporary sites](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1103.php); [Transit point location for sources of perspective nourishment](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1093.php).
