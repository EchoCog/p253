### Pattern template

Local coordination within a domain can only be effectively achieved through the formation of appropriately located local focal points.

**Physical** Local government of communities, with the full participation of inhabitants, can best be ensured by provision of a small town hall for each community of about 7000. This should be located near the busiest intersection in the community. It should provide for a public discussion arena, public services, and community project offices.

**Social** Coordination of any specialized group or organizational complex, with the full participation of those involved, can best be ensured by creation of a common service environment. This should be associated with the main nexus of communications amongst participants. It should provide an arena for public discussion, common services, and project management facilities.

**Conceptual** Integration of any specialized conceptual domain or school of thought can best be ensured by promoting the emergence of a common framework, preferably associated with the main nexus of conceptual relationships, to facilitate interrelationships between concepts.

**Psychic** Integration of any specialized mode of awareness can best be ensured by encouraging the emergence of a focal insight, preferably associated with the main nexus of perceptual relationships.

**Broader** [Activity nodes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1030.php); [Functional cycle](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1026.php); [Underdefined processes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1033.php); [Individuality in multiplicity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1012.php).
