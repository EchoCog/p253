### Pattern template

Some beneficial modes of relationship cannot be satisfactorily combined with others and call for the establishment of a distinct network with appropriate adaptation at the interfaces with other modes.

**Physical** Bicycles are endangered by other vehicles on roads and are themselves a danger to pedestrians on pathways, despite being a healthy mode of transport with little negative impact on the environment. This calls for the establishment of a system of appropriately adapted bicycle paths with bike racks located close to common destinations.

**Broader** [Local relationship loops](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1049.php); [Local interrelationship domains](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1011.php); [Interfacing vehicles of communication and networks of unmediated relationships](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1052.php).

**Narrower** [Protection of emerging foci](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1057.php); [Partially contained interfaces](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1119.php); [Low-intensity communication pathways](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1059.php); [Distinctiveness of main entry point to structure](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1110.php); [Protecting non-linear contexts from communication pathways](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1173.php); [Contexts for exploratory relationship formation challenging emerging perspectives](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1073.php).
