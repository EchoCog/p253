### Pattern template

The distinctiveness of any domain is enhanced by the presence of well-identified points of entry through its boundary.

**Physical** The identity of neighbourhoods, housing clusters or other urban precincts is enhanced by the presence of distinctive gateways for the pathways through the boundary.

**Broader** [Context boundary](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1015.php); [Identifiable context](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1014.php); [Cluster of frameworks](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1037.php); [Informal context for formal processes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1041.php).

**Narrower** [Hospitable transit points](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1092.php); [Patterning of complex structures](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1098.php); [Context for transformative experience](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1066.php); [Common external context for inactivity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1069.php); [Complexification of perspective contexts](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1095.php); [Distinctiveness of main entry point to structure](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1110.php); [Limitation on number of occupiable temporary sites](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1103.php); [Distinct pattern of entry points to complex structures](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1102.php); [Transition domain between structure and communication pathway](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1112.php).
