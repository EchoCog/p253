### Pattern template

The development of a domain is facilitated by integrating into its structure contexts in which a variety of new dimensions are represented, whether or not they finally provide a basis for such development.

**Physical** The development of an urban environment may be facilitated by providing a range of structures linked by pathways within which people can meet to explore new ideas and projects. These may take the form of a university, a community education centre or a conference centre.

**Social** The development of an organizational complex or community may be facilitated by providing a range of interlinked meeting opportunities within which people can choose to receive or offer ideas or instruction, whether in the form of classes, lectures, conferences, or as a marketplace of projects.

**Conceptual** The development of a conceptual domain or a body of knowledge may be facilitated by providing a range of interlinked opportunities for the confrontation of different concepts, whether deriving from different levels of education, from different sources of information, or from different ideology or belief systems.

**Psychic** The development of a mode of awareness may be facilitated by ensuring a range of interlinked conditions within which incompatible perceptions are confronted, whether as paradoxes or deriving from different mind-sets.

**Broader** [Activity nodes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1030.php); [Network of redefinitions](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1018.php); [Cycle of relationship reinforcement](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1031.php).
