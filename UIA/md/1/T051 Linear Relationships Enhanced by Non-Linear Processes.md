### Pattern template

Local linear relationships may be enhanced by ensuring the presence of non-linear processes such that the linearity tends to become implicit rather than explicit.

**Physical** Local asphalt roads destroy the micro- climate and the local environment. Substituting paving stones with grass between them alleviates such effects.

**Broader** [Non-linear organization](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1007.php); [Local relationship loops](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1049.php); [Local interrelationship domains](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1011.php); [Three-way relationship entrainment](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1050.php); [Compensating relationships in parallel](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1023.php); [Differentiation by relationship density](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1036.php).

**Narrower** [Ambiguous boundaries](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1243.php); [Unstructured common domain](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1067.php); [Protection of emerging foci](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1057.php); [Embedding fixity within variability](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1247.php); [Cultivation of productive non-linearity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1170.php); [Protecting variability to enhance fixity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1245.php); [Hierachy of perspectives favouring the broadest](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1114.php); [Overview of communication pathway from structure](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1164.php); [Interaction with coherent irrational perspectives](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1074.php); [Limitation on number of occupiable temporary sites](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1103.php); [Distinct pattern of entry points to complex structures](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1102.php); [Spontaneous relationship formation amongst emerging perspectives](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1068.php); [Relative isolation of structural interface with communication pathway](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1140.php); [Interfacing vehicles of communication and networks of unmediated relationships](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1052.php).
