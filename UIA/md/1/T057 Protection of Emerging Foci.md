### Pattern template

A specially protected network of relationships should be provided to enable new foci to emerge and develop their potential for interaction with the organized domain in which they will become established.

**Physical** A specially protected network of pathways should be provided to enable children to explore the variety of buildings which make up the urban environment in which they have to learn to function as adults.
