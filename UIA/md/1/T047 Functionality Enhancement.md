### Pattern template

In any domain a significant proportion of the processes tend to be dysfunctional. A network of nodes catalyzing and enhancing functionality is desirable.

**Physical** In any ordinary neighbourhood more than 90 per cent of the people are unhealthy in terms of simple biological criteria. Their health cannot be effectively enhanced by focusing on illnesses. A network of centres is required, with medical facilities, but focusing on the enhancement of physical and mental health through recreational and educational activities.

**Social** In any ordinary group or organizational complex a significant proportion of the roles exhibit dysfunctional characteristics in terms of the health of the organization. These cannot be effectively remedied by focusing directly upon them. A network of facilitative environments is required with counselling expertise but providing the opportunity for role health, exploration and development.

**Conceptual** In any ordinary conceptual environment or school of thought a significant proportion of the conceptual portions or processes exhibit dysfunctional characteristics in terms of the integration of the domain as a whole. These cannot be effectively remedied by focusing directly upon them. A network of facilitative conceptual environments is required with consultative expertise but providing the opportunity for creative exercises in the exploration and further development of such positions.

**Psychic** Within any ordinary mode of awareness a significant proportion of the perceptions are unhealthy with respect to the holistic integration of that mode. Such perceptions cannot be effectively improved by focusing directly upon them. A network of facilitative processes is required with integrative potential but providing the opportunity for reflective exercises in the exploration and further development of such perceptions.

**Broader** [Activity nodes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1030.php); [Functional cycle](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1026.php); [Local action network](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1045.php).

**Narrower** [Adaptive interstices](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1048.php); [Access to contained irrationality](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1071.php); [Context for emergence of new perspectives](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1065.php); [Local opportunities for perspective activity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1157.php); [Provision for temporary perspective inactivity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1150.php); [Minimally-structured perspective control operations](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1081.php); [Local cultivation of sources of perspective nourishment](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1177.php); [Exposure of structural activities to communication pathway](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1165.php); [Competitive interaction opportunities transposed to a concrete level](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1072.php); [Contexts for exploratory relationship formation challenging emerging perspectives](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1073.php).
