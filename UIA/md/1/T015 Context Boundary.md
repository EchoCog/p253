### Pattern template

The strength of the boundary is essential to the maintenance of an identifiable context. An appropriate boundary emerges as the number of relationships to the external environment is limited.

**Physical** The strength of the boundary is essential to the maintenance of the identifiable character of the neighbourhood. The boundary may be formed by closing down some streets crossing the neighbourhood thus limiting access to the neighbourhood.

**Social** The strength of the boundary is essential to the maintenance of the identifiable character of a group or functional unit. The boundary may be formed by cutting off some communication pathway through the group and restricting access to the group's activity.

**Conceptual** The strength of the boundary is essential to the maintenance of the identifiable character of a conceptual system. The definition may be articulated by establishing distinctions from the pattern of general relationships within which the system is embedded.

**Psychic** The strength of the distinction between modes of awareness is essential to the maintenance of the identifiable character of any focal, ground or "home" mode. The distinction may be reinforced by developing the sense of primacy or groundedness associated with such a mode in contrast to others.
