### Pattern template

A local focal point only acquires significance in a domain when it is embedded in a local action network whose activities it facilitates.

**Physical** A local town hall functions more effectively when it surrounds itself with shop-size spaces available to community action groups. Availability of low-cost office space is a vital catalyst to the initiatives of effective group action.

**Social** A common service environment can only be effective when it is embedded in a network of specialized action projects, each testing its views within the community and mobilizing support and resources. Such a network is basic to the self-regulation of any community.

**Conceptual** An integrative common framework only acquires significance in a specialized conceptual domain when it is embedded in a network of investigative initiatives whose activities it facilitates.

**Psychic** A focal insight only acquires significance within any specialized mode of awareness when it is embedded within a network perception whose value it enhances.

**Broader** [Local focal points](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1044.php); [Presentation of new dimensions](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1043.php).

**Narrower** [Functionality enhancement](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1047.php); [Common external context for inactivity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1069.php); [Minimally-structured perspective control operations](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1081.php); [Exchange contexts controlled by a single perspective](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1087.php); [Exposure of structural activities to communication pathway](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1165.php); [Hospitable interface between structures and external environment](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1160.php); [Direct relationship between structures and communication pathways](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1122.php).
