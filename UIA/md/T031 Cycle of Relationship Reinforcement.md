### Pattern template

Within any domain, linking the activity nodes together through a fundamental cycle reinforces specific relationships as well as the integrity of the domain as a whole.

**Physical** In any urban community the gradual formation of a promenade linking the main activity nodes provides an environment through which people are encouraged to move constantly in order to see and to be seen, especially if the principal nodes are located at each end. Such a promenade provides a focus for the life of the community.

**Social** In any organizational complex or group, linking facilitative nodes together in a communication circuit provides an environment through which people are encouraged to move constantly in order to encounter new and alternative activities and the associated relationships. Such a cycle reinforces existing relationships and the integrity of the group as a whole.

**Conceptual** In any conceptual domain or school of thought, linking together the key foci of conceptual activity in a cycle of conceptual processes provides an environment through which ideas are encouraged to move constantly in order to be challenged by new or alternative insights and the associated conceptual relationships. Such a cycle reinforces existing relationships and the integrity of that body of knowledge as a whole.

**Psychic** Within any mode of awareness, linking key perceptual processes together within a larger cyclic process provides a context through which attention is encouraged to move constantly in order to encounter new or alternative insights and the patterns of significance within which they are embedded. Such a cycle renews existing relationships and the integrity of the mode of awareness as a whole.

**Broader** [Activity nodes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1030.php); [Access to intensity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1010.php); [Relationship to indeterminacy](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1025.php); [Individuality in multiplicity](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1012.php); [Variety of forms and processes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1008.php); [Coherent pattern of relationship densities](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1028.php); [Stable density gradient of local relationships](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1029.php).
