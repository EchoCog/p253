This explores the parallel between patterns at the physical level, the social level, the conceptual level, and the psychic level in the light of an underlying template based on the insights of Christopher Alexander"

### Pattern template

Vehicles of communication may endanger the local communication process although significant activities occur at the points at which they interface with zones of unmediated relationships. A protected network of unmediated relationships may be developed distinct from that of the mediated network and orthogonal to it.

**Physical** Automobiles are dangerous to pedestrians and yet social life is enlivened at the points where they meet. A protected network of pedestrian paths may be developed, distinct from the road system, and orthogonal to it.

**Broader** [Activity nodes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1030.php); [Standard frameworks](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1038.php); [Local relationship loops](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1049.php); [Selective interchange axis](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1032.php); [Local interrelationship domains](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1011.php); [Cycle of relationship reinforcement](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1031.php); [Compensating relationships in parallel](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1023.php); [Linear relationships enhanced by non-linear processes](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1051.php).
