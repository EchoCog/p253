## **Design Problem:**

How do you teach players complex game systems without overwhelming them at the start? New players often abandon games when confronted with too many mechanics, controls, or options simultaneously. The paradox is that interesting games require complexity, but complexity creates barriers to entry. When players feel overwhelmed or confused in the opening moments, they may never discover the game's deeper satisfactions.

## **Pattern Description:**

To help players learn complex game systems without overwhelming them, a designer may gradually introduce mechanics, controls, and options over time because this allows players to build competency incrementally and develop confidence before facing greater challenges.

This pattern works by carefully sequencing the revelation of game elements. Rather than presenting all available actions and systems at once, the game introduces one or two core mechanics first, allows the player to practice and internalize them, then adds new layers of complexity. Each new element builds upon previously mastered skills, creating a scaffolded learning experience.

The key principle is that cognitive load must be managed carefully. Players can only process a limited amount of new information at once. By controlling the rate of information delivery, designers can ensure that each new concept has time to be understood and practiced before additional complexity is introduced.

This approach also creates natural moments of mastery and accomplishment. As players become comfortable with basic mechanics, they often crave additional complexity. The gradual disclosure of new systems provides regular moments of discovery and expanded capability, maintaining engagement over time.

The pattern must be balanced carefully - too slow and experienced players become bored, too fast and newcomers become overwhelmed. The ideal pacing varies based on the target audience and the complexity of the underlying systems.

## **Games that use this pattern and how:**

### **Super Mario Bros.**
The first level teaches jumping by requiring it to progress, then introduces enemies that must be jumped on, then moving platforms, then power-ups. Each mechanic is introduced in isolation before being combined with others. This creates a perfect difficulty curve that has influenced game design for decades.

### **Portal**
The game starts with simple room-to-room navigation using portals, then gradually adds momentum puzzles, deadly hazards, and complex multi-room challenges. Each test chamber introduces one new concept while reinforcing previously learned skills. The pacing allows players to think through solutions methodically.

### **Civilization VI**
New civilizations, technologies, and game systems are unlocked progressively through research and exploration. Early decisions are simpler with fewer variables, but as the game progresses, the strategic depth increases. Tutorial systems guide new players through increasingly complex diplomatic, economic, and military considerations.

### **Parent Patterns:**
- [[Learning Curve Management]] — Progressive disclosure requires careful attention to how difficulty scales over time

### **Child Patterns:**
- [[Safe Practice Spaces]] — Areas where players can experiment with new mechanics without consequence
- [[Contextual Hints]] — Just-in-time information delivery to support newly introduced mechanics

### **Additive Patterns:**
- [[Mastery Recognition]] — Acknowledging when players have learned systems reinforces progressive disclosure
- [[Player Choice Expansion]] — Gradually opening up more options as players demonstrate competency

### **Subtractive Patterns:**
- [[Information Overload Prevention]] — Actively limiting information to prevent cognitive overwhelm
- [[Option Paralysis Mitigation]] — Reducing choices early to prevent decision-making difficulties

### **Alternate Patterns:**
- [[Deep End Immersion]] — Some games benefit from immediately presenting full complexity
