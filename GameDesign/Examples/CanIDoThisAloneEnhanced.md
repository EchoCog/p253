## **Audience:**

### **Primary Audience:**
- **Age Range:** 12+ years old
- **Gaming Experience:** Intermediate players comfortable with both solo and cooperative play
- **Demographics:** Players who value both personal achievement and social gaming experiences

### **Secondary Audiences:**
- Competitive players who want to prove individual skill
- Social gamers who prefer cooperative experiences
- Players with inconsistent multiplayer availability

## **Design Problem:**

### **Primary Design Problem:**
How do you design challenges that are engaging whether tackled alone or with friends, without making solo play frustratingly difficult or cooperative play trivially easy?

---

## **Additional Pattern Problems:**

### **Problem 2:**
How do you maintain individual agency and contribution recognition in cooperative contexts?

### **Problem 3:**
How do you accommodate players who want to transition between solo and social play within the same game session?

### **Problem 4:**
How do you create meaningful choice between cooperation and independence without penalizing either approach?

### **Problem 5:**
How do you prevent more skilled players from trivializing content for less experienced cooperative partners?

### **Problem 6:**
How do you balance risk/reward ratios across different group sizes?

### **Problem 7:**
How do you design encounters that remain mechanically interesting regardless of participant count?

## **Context and Consequences:**

### **Context:**
This pattern works best in games with scalable challenges such as action RPGs, survival games, tactical combat games, or puzzle games where complexity can be adjusted dynamically. Most effective when the core gameplay involves overcoming discrete challenges rather than narrative-driven experiences.

### **Consequences:**

**Positive Consequences:**
- Increased player retention through flexible social options
- Broader appeal across different player preference types  
- Natural difficulty progression that adapts to player choices
- Enhanced replayability through different cooperation approaches
- Players can demonstrate mastery through solo achievements

**Potential Negative Consequences:**
- Significantly increased development complexity for challenge balancing
- Risk of creating unintended optimal strategies (always solo or always group)
- Potential social pressure or judgment around cooperation choices
- May fragment player base if social features are poorly implemented
- Resource scaling can lead to unbalanced economic systems

**Situational Effects:**
- Effectiveness varies greatly with the game's core social culture
- Players with social anxiety may avoid cooperative options entirely
- Time zone differences can force players into solo play unintentionally
- Skill disparities between friends can create tension rather than cooperation

---

## **Constraints:**

### **Internal Constraints:**
- Game must have quantifiable difficulty metrics that can be scaled
- Challenge design must be modular enough to scale meaningfully
- Requires robust systems for detecting and responding to group composition
- Core gameplay must remain engaging at different complexity levels
- Must have clear individual contribution tracking mechanisms

### **External Constraints:**
- **Budget:** Requires extensive playtesting across different group compositions and skill levels
- **Studio Size:** Needs specialized systems designers familiar with cooperative game balance
- **Engine Features:** Requires dynamic difficulty adjustment systems and seamless multiplayer integration
- **Platform:** Cross-platform play considerations for maintaining player pools
- **Timeline:** Balancing solo and cooperative variants typically requires 6+ months additional development

## **Pattern Description:**

To create challenges that are equally engaging for solo players and cooperative groups, a designer may implement dynamic difficulty scaling that adjusts challenge complexity, resource availability, and mechanical requirements based on the number and skill level of participants because this allows players to choose their preferred social interaction level without compromising the gameplay experience.

This pattern works by identifying the core challenge elements that can be scaled without fundamentally changing the experience. Rather than simply adjusting enemy health pools, effective implementation modifies puzzle complexity, resource management requirements, tactical coordination needs, and time pressures. The key insight is that different group sizes excel at different types of challenges - solo players can focus deeply and make quick decisions, while groups can coordinate complex strategies and cover more ground simultaneously.

The scaling mechanism must be transparent enough that players understand how their choices affect the experience, but not so mechanical that it feels gamey. The best implementations make the scaling feel like a natural consequence of the cooperation choice rather than an artificial adjustment.

Critical to success is ensuring that neither solo nor cooperative play feels like the "intended" way to play. Both approaches should offer distinct but equivalent satisfactions. Solo players might get satisfaction from perfect execution and self-reliance, while cooperative players enjoy coordination and shared achievement.

The pattern requires careful attention to unintended consequences such as players feeling pressured to play in ways they don't prefer, or optimal strategies emerging that bypass the intended design choices.

## **Example Games:**

### **Divinity: Original Sin 2** - Problems 1, 2, 4
Combat encounters scale the number and abilities of enemies based on party size, but more importantly, environmental puzzles and dialogue challenges can be approached differently with different party compositions. Solo players must be more strategic and creative, while cooperative players can specialize roles and coordinate complex strategies. The game never makes either approach feel suboptimal.

### **Deep Rock Galactic** - Problems 1, 3, 6
Mission complexity, enemy spawn rates, and resource requirements scale dynamically based on team size. Solo players get a robotic companion and modified objectives that play to single-player strengths (careful exploration, methodical progress), while full teams face chaotic combat scenarios requiring coordination. Players can seamlessly join or leave missions, with difficulty adjusting in real-time.

### **Portal 2 Co-op Campaign** - Problems 1, 2, 7  
Entirely separate campaign designed specifically for two-player cooperation, with puzzles that are literally impossible to solve alone but require equal contribution from both players. Rather than scaling single-player content, it creates parallel content optimized for the cooperative experience while maintaining the core Portal mechanics.

- Baldur's Gate 3
- Wasteland 3  
- Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire

**Similar to Deep Rock Galactic (dynamic scaling):**
- Risk of Rain 2
- Borderlands series
- Monster Hunter World

**Similar to Portal 2 (parallel design):**
- It Takes Two
- A Way Out
- Overcooked! series

## **Related Patterns:**

### **Parent Patterns:**
- [[Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment]] — Required for real-time scaling based on group composition
- [[Meaningful Choice Architecture]] — Solo vs. cooperative must be genuine choice

### **Child Patterns:**
- [[Individual Contribution Recognition]] — Players need to see their personal impact in group settings  
- [[Seamless Social Transitions]] — Support for players joining/leaving without disruption
- [[Skill-Based Matchmaking]] — Grouping players of similar abilities when cooperation is chosen

### **Additive Patterns:**
- [[Complementary Abilities]] — Different player roles that enhance cooperative play
- [[Shared Achievement Systems]] — Recognition that celebrates both individual and group accomplishments
- [[Communication Tools]] — Built-in systems that facilitate coordination

### **Subtractive Patterns:**
- [[Carry Prevention]] — Systems that prevent high-skill players from trivializing content for others
- [[Social Pressure Mitigation]] — Design that reduces judgment about cooperation choices
- [[Optimal Strategy Prevention]] — Avoiding dominant strategies that favor one approach

### **Alternate Patterns:**
- [[Forced Cooperation]] — Some games benefit from requiring teamwork rather than making it optional
- [[Pure Solo Design]] — Some experiences are diminished by any social elements
