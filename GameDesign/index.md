# Game Design Pattern Templates

This directory contains templates and examples for documenting game design patterns based on the methodology described in "Pattern Language for Game Design".

## Quick Start

1. **Choose a template** based on your needs (see [Template Selection](#template-selection) below)
2. **Copy the appropriate template file**
3. **Replace bracketed placeholders** with your pattern content
4. **Remove instructional text** (shown in italics)
5. **Review examples** for guidance on writing quality patterns

## Files in this Directory

### Templates
- [`FirstEditionTemplate.md`](Templates/FirstEditionTemplate.md) - Original pattern template structure
- [`EnhancedEditionTemplate.md`](Templates/EnhancedEditionTemplate.md) - Extended template with additional fields

### Documentation  
- [`README.md`](README.md) - Comprehensive guide to using the templates
- [`EnhancedFeaturesGuide.md`](EnhancedFeaturesGuide.md) - Quick reference for enhanced template features

### Examples
- [`ProgressiveDisclosureFirstEdition.md`](Examples/ProgressiveDisclosureFirstEdition.md) - Single-problem pattern using first edition template
- [`ProgressiveDisclosureEnhanced.md`](Examples/ProgressiveDisclosureEnhanced.md) - Same pattern using enhanced template
- [`CanIDoThisAloneEnhanced.md`](Examples/CanIDoThisAloneEnhanced.md) - Multi-problem pattern using enhanced template

## Template Selection

### Use First Edition Template When:
- ✅ Creating your first game design patterns
- ✅ Working with tight documentation timelines  
- ✅ Focusing on core pattern documentation
- ✅ Teaching pattern languages to newcomers
- ✅ Creating internal team reference patterns

### Use Enhanced Edition Template When:
- ✅ Creating comprehensive pattern documentation
- ✅ Working on academic or research projects
- ✅ Developing patterns for diverse audiences
- ✅ Building professional pattern libraries
- ✅ Documenting complex patterns with multiple effects

## Pattern Template Comparison

| Field | First Edition | Enhanced Edition | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Name | ✅ | ✅ | Memorable pattern identifier |
| Descriptive Title | ❌ | ✅ | Clarify abstract names |
| Confidence | ✅ | ✅ | Viability rating (1-10) |
| Image | ✅ | ✅ | Visual representation |
| Authors | ✅ | ✅ | Pattern creators |
| Audience | ❌ | ✅ | Target player demographics |
| Design Problem | ✅ | ✅ | Core challenge addressed |
| Additional Problems | ❌ | ✅ | Multiple problem support |
| Context & Consequences | ❌ | ✅ | When to apply, what effects |
| Constraints | ❌ | ✅ | Internal/external limitations |
| Pattern Description | ✅ | ✅ | Detailed solution explanation |
| Game Examples | ✅ | ✅ | Real implementation examples |
| Secondary Examples | ❌ | ✅ | Grouped similar implementations |
| Seed | ✅ | ✅ | Original inspiration |
| Related Patterns | ✅ | ✅ | Pattern relationships |
| Keywords | ✅ | ✅ | Non-hierarchical linking |

## Writing Guidelines Summary

### Essential Principles
1. **Solve real problems** - Every pattern should address a genuine game design challenge
2. **Provide specific examples** - Show how real games implement the pattern differently  
3. **Be actionable** - Designers should be able to apply the pattern from your description
4. **Connect to other patterns** - Show relationships to build a cohesive language
5. **Use consistent keywords** - Enable cross-pattern discovery and navigation

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Pattern name is memorable and evocative
- [ ] Problem is clearly stated and relatable
- [ ] Solution is detailed with multiple paragraphs
- [ ] Examples are diverse and well-explained
- [ ] Related patterns show meaningful connections
- [ ] Keywords enable discoverability
- [ ] Confidence rating reflects actual certainty

## Pattern Language Philosophy

These templates support Christopher Alexander's vision of pattern languages - interconnected solutions that work together to address complex design challenges. In game design, this means:

- **Patterns solve player experience problems** rather than technical implementation issues
- **Patterns connect and reinforce each other** to create cohesive design approaches  
- **Patterns capture proven solutions** from successful games while remaining adaptable
- **Patterns serve both education and practice** for game designers at all levels

## Contributing to Pattern Libraries

When using these templates to contribute to pattern collections:

1. **Follow established conventions** for naming and keyword usage
2. **Review existing patterns** to avoid duplication and find connection opportunities
3. **Test your patterns** by applying them to real design challenges
4. **Iterate based on feedback** from other designers using your patterns
5. **Maintain consistency** with the chosen template format throughout your contributions

## Next Steps

1. **Read the full documentation** in [`README.md`](README.md)
2. **Study the examples** to understand effective pattern writing
3. **Choose your template** based on your documentation needs
4. **Start writing patterns** for game design challenges you've encountered
5. **Build connections** between your patterns to create a cohesive language

The goal is not just to document individual design solutions, but to build a comprehensive language that helps game designers create better player experiences through proven, interconnected design patterns.
