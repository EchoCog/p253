# Game Design Pattern Template - Enhanced Edition

This template includes all fields from the first edition plus new enhancements described in the updated "Pattern Language for Game Design".

---

## **Name:**
*This should be an easy-to-remember and evocative name.*

[Pattern Name Here]

---

## **Descriptive Title:**
*The descriptive title field provides a short practical title for the pattern to clarify and provide context to the more memorable pattern name.*

[Descriptive Title Here]

*Example: The pattern "And Now I Guess We Are Doing This" has the descriptive title "Changing Player Behavior Through Consequences."*

---

## **Confidence:**
*This number rates the level of certainty you have that a pattern is viable for use in developing games: how sure you are that it will have the indicated effects and any side effects it might have.*

**Confidence Level:** [1-10 scale]

---

## **Image:**
*An iconic image to represent each pattern. This image can convey the essence of the pattern and serve as a mnemonic anchor for remembering it.*

![Pattern Image](image-url-or-path)

*Image Description: [Describe what the image represents and how it relates to the pattern]*

---

## **Authors:**
*This is the name of the pattern creator or creators.*

- [Author Name 1]
- [Author Name 2] (if applicable)

---

## **Audience:**
*The audience field captures the demographic aspects of a player that define a group for which the pattern is effective. A pattern may have one or more audiences defined for it.*

### **Primary Audience:**
- **Age Range:** [e.g., 8-10 years old, 16-25 years old, adults]
- **Gaming Experience:** [e.g., casual players, experienced gamers, competitive players]
- **Demographics:** [e.g., specific cultural groups, geographic regions, interests]

### **Secondary Audiences:**
- [Additional audience groups for which this pattern may be effective]

---

## **Design Problem:**
*Each pattern exists to solve a problem. Describe that problem here. The problem can often be stated as a question. Identifying the problem is critical to knowing when and if you want to use the pattern.*

### **Primary Design Problem:**
[Describe the main design problem this pattern solves. This should be detailed and specific to game design challenges.]

---

## **Additional Pattern Problems:**
*Most patterns should address a single clear problem. However, sometimes a pattern has additional effects that occur regardless of the designer's intent.*

### **Problem 2:**
[Describe additional problem if applicable - use sparingly]

### **Problem 3:**
[Describe additional problem if applicable - use sparingly]

*Note: It is preferable to break a pattern down into less complex patterns rather than adding many problems to an overly complex pattern description.*

---

## **Context and Consequences:**

### **Context:**
*Describes the context in which a pattern is best applied.*

[Describe the situations, game types, or development contexts where this pattern is most effective.]

### **Consequences:**
*Describes additional effects that instantiating the pattern is likely to create. These can be positive or negative, and may be situational.*

**Positive Consequences:**
- [Positive effect 1]
- [Positive effect 2]

**Potential Negative Consequences:**
- [Potential negative effect 1]
- [Potential negative effect 2]

**Situational Effects:**
- [Effects that depend on specific constraints or contexts]

---

## **Constraints:**
*Constraints can be internal to the game design or external to the development environment.*

### **Internal Constraints:**
*Constraints within the game design itself.*
- [e.g., Only effective for games in 3D space]
- [e.g., Requires traversal mechanic]
- [e.g., Works best in multiplayer contexts]

### **External Constraints:**
*Development environment constraints.*
- **Budget:** [Budget considerations]
- **Studio Size:** [Team size requirements]
- **Engine Features:** [Technical requirements]
- **Platform:** [Platform-specific considerations]
- **Timeline:** [Development time considerations]

---

## **Pattern Description:**
*Provide a detailed description of the pattern here. This section should go into as much depth as possible. Start with the format: To [achieve some design effect], a designer may [take some design action, use some mechanic, etc.] because [explanation of how the pattern produces the desired effect].*

To [achieve some design effect], a designer may [take some design action, use some mechanic, etc.] because [explanation of how the pattern produces the desired effect].

[Expand with several paragraphs discussing the pattern with detail and nuance. Do not try to be concise to the point of reducing your description to a single sentence.]

---

## **Example Games:**
*Provide examples of games with full descriptions of their unique implementations of the pattern.*

### **[Game Name 1]** - [Problem # addressed]
[Detailed description of how the game applies the pattern. This should explain the specific implementation and how the game creates dynamics in the player experience that solve the problem.]

### **[Game Name 2]** - [Problem # addressed]
[Description of how this game uses the pattern in a different way, showing the pattern's versatility.]

---

## **Secondary Examples:**
*Games that share similar implementations with the main examples.*

**Similar to [Game Name 1]:**
- [Game A]
- [Game B]
- [Game C]

**Similar to [Game Name 2]:**
- [Game D]
- [Game E]

---

## **Seed:**
*This is the idea that was the starting point for the pattern.*

Exercise [XX]: Exercise Name — [Game Element]

*This records the original inspiration or exercise that led to this pattern, important for connecting patterns into a language.*

---

## **Related Patterns:**
*This section includes patterns that are related to this pattern. The description should be of how that pattern relates to this one.*

### **Parent Patterns:**
*Patterns required by this pattern to function well.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Child Patterns:**
*Patterns that this pattern suggests or requires to function well.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Additive Patterns:**
*Patterns that enhance the effect of the pattern being described.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Subtractive Patterns:**
*Patterns that mitigate the effect of others, often desirable for gameplay balance.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Alternate Patterns:**
*Patterns that represent one side of a binary choice.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

---

## **Keywords:**
*Keywords that relate to this pattern. Use keywords to link this pattern to others in a non-hierarchical way. Having twenty keywords is usually better than having five.*

`keyword1`, `keyword2`, `keyword3`, `keyword4`, `keyword5`, `keyword6`, `keyword7`, `keyword8`, `keyword9`, `keyword10`, `gameplay-mechanics`, `player-experience`, `game-design`, `pattern-language`, `[additional-relevant-keywords]`
