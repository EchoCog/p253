# Game Design Pattern Template - First Edition

This template follows the structure described in the first edition of "Pattern Language for Game Design".

---

## **Name:**
*This should be an easy-to-remember and evocative name.*

[Pattern Name Here]

---

## **Confidence:**
*This number rates the level of certainty you have that a pattern is viable for use in developing games: how sure you are that it will have the indicated effects and any side effects it might have.*

**Confidence Level:** [1-10 scale]

---

## **Image:**
*An iconic image to represent each pattern. This image can convey the essence of the pattern and serve as a mnemonic anchor for remembering it.*

![Pattern Image](image-url-or-path)

*Image Description: [Describe what the image represents and how it relates to the pattern]*

---

## **Authors:**
*This is the name of the pattern creator or creators.*

- [Author Name 1]
- [Author Name 2] (if applicable)

---

## **Design Problem:**
*Each pattern exists to solve a problem. Describe that problem here. The problem can often be stated as a question. Identifying the problem is critical to knowing when and if you want to use the pattern.*

[Describe the design problem this pattern solves. This should be detailed and specific to game design challenges.]

---

## **Pattern Description:**
*Provide a detailed description of the pattern here. This section should go into as much depth as possible. Start with the format: To [achieve some design effect], a designer may [take some design action, use some mechanic, etc.] because [explanation of how the pattern produces the desired effect].*

To [achieve some design effect], a designer may [take some design action, use some mechanic, etc.] because [explanation of how the pattern produces the desired effect].

[Expand with several paragraphs discussing the pattern with detail and nuance. Do not try to be concise to the point of reducing your description to a single sentence.]

---

## **Games that use this pattern and how:**
*Provide examples of some instances of the pattern's implementation. These examples should be as different from each other as possible.*

### **[Game Name 1]** 
[Description of how the game applies the pattern. This should be at least a full sentence that makes sense to another designer. Explain how the game creates dynamics in the player experience that solve the problem.]

### **[Game Name 2]**
[Description of how this game uses the pattern in a different way, showing the pattern's versatility.]

### **[Game Name 3]**
[Another example showing yet another application of the pattern.]

---

## **Seed:**
*This is the idea that was the starting point for the pattern.*

Exercise [XX]: Exercise Name — [Game Element]

*This records the original inspiration or exercise that led to this pattern, important for connecting patterns into a language.*

---

## **Related Patterns:**
*This section includes patterns that are related to this pattern. The description should be of how that pattern relates to this one.*

### **Parent Patterns:**
*Patterns required by this pattern to function well.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Child Patterns:**
*Patterns that this pattern suggests or requires to function well.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Additive Patterns:**
*Patterns that enhance the effect of the pattern being described.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Subtractive Patterns:**
*Patterns that mitigate the effect of others, often desirable for gameplay balance.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

### **Alternate Patterns:**
*Patterns that represent one side of a binary choice.*
- [[Pattern Name]] — [Description of relationship]

---

## **Keywords:**
*Keywords that relate to this pattern. Use keywords to link this pattern to others in a non-hierarchical way. Having twenty keywords is usually better than having five.*

`keyword1`, `keyword2`, `keyword3`, `keyword4`, `keyword5`, `keyword6`, `keyword7`, `keyword8`, `keyword9`, `keyword10`, `gameplay-mechanics`, `player-experience`, `game-design`, `pattern-language`, `[additional-relevant-keywords]`
