# Pattern 006: Intermediate Scale Organization

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

The activities of a large and growing organizational complex attract further participation. It is consequently difficult for smaller organizations to offer processes of equivalent attractiveness to ensure their viability. Where such intermediate bodies exist they should be preserved. The growth of new self-reliant forms of organization should be encouraged. The functional domain should be collectively concerned to ensure their viability and avoid their development into dependent or "front" organizations.
