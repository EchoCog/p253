# Pattern 002: Distribution Of Organization

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

If a functional domain is characterized by smaller groups to too great an extent, larger and more complex forms of organization cannot emerge. But if such a domain is characterized by larger and more complex forms of organization to too great an extent, such forms of organization will prove detrimental to the integrity of the functional domain. Groups of different size and degrees of organization should be distributed evenly throughout the functional domain.
