# Pattern 030: Activity Nodes

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

As an organizational complex develops, facilitative nodes emerge randomly, thus failing to reinforce each other or the vitality of the group or network as a whole. This may be remedied by concentrating mutually supportive network facilities at activity nodes (such as meetings organized regularly to serve different interest groups) on which the network of relationships naturally converge.
