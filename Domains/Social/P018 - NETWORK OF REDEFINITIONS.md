# Pattern 018: Network Of Redefinitions

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

In a society or group which emphasizes the inculcation of some particular pattern of behaviour and perception, individuals become passive and unable to think or act for themselves. Creative, active individuals and groups can only emerge in a society which promotes networks of decentralized learning instead of emphasizing structured teaching systems.
