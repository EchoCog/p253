# Pattern 027: Complementarity

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

In order to ensure appropriate balance within any organization or community, each procedure and activity should be developed with a blend of incommensurable insights (as typified by those of men and women). If groups and programmes are developed in which either of such insights is repressed, such structures perpetuate and give form to the resulting distortion of reality.
