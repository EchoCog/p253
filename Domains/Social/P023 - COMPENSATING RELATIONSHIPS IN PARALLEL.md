# Pattern 023: Compensating Relationships In Parallel

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Even when high intensity, non- local communication media are used to deflect such communication around an organization's boundary, severe local communication overload and underuse may result within any communication networks within the organization or community. This may be avoided by developing systems of parallel and alternating unilateral communication pathways to carry information to and from the bounding non-local communication media. Local and specialized groups can effectively define themselves in relationship to such alternating communication pathways.
