# Pattern 004: Regenerative Resource Cultivation Areas

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

The functional areas most favourable to regeneration of social resources are also those in which organizations can most easily be established. The availability of such areas is however limited and once denatured by the establishment of organizations, their resource regeneration function cannot easily be recovered. Such functional areas should therefore be protected from attempts at organization.
