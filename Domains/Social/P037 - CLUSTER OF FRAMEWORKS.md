# Pattern 037: Cluster Of Frameworks

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

The fundamental unit of local organization in any identifiable social span is the (proximity) cluster of groups (or people) with related preoccupations. The limit on the number of groups (or people) per cluster varies from 8 to 12 depending on the balance between the informality of the relationships within the cluster and the coherence of the cluster as a whole. The relationships between the groups (or people) should preferably be such as to define an area of commonly held concern.
