# Pattern 011: Local Interrelationship Domains

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Non-local communication media, when employed locally, inhibit the articulation and social development of community organization and destroy its integrity. The functional domain as a whole should be broken down into local communication areas, each with direct access to non-local communication media. Within such areas, group and interpersonal communication networks should be developed for internal purposes, appropriately connected to (and protected from) the non-local communication media.
