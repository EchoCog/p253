# Pattern 016: Web Of General Interrelationships

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

The web of public communication facilities can only work if all social actors are connected by it. This tends not to be the case because of the privileged role accorded to the mass media and the difficulty of translating information between different modes of communication, especially when adapted to particular profiles. This difficulty can be reduced by treating the translation arenas as primary and the actual lines of communication as secondary. Specialized groups controlling the translation arenas can then require guarantees of a desirable level of adaptation to particular profiles.
