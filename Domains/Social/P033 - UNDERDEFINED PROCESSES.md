# Pattern 033: Underdefined Processes

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Associated with every organizational complex or group there are extra-mural activities to which participants are attracted during interruptions in the cycle of normal group activity. These range from drinking together through office recreation clubs, group celebrations, parties, collective participation in carnivals and excursions, to other forms of group entertainment. Such activities need to be clustered in space and/or time if they are to provide lively secure environments in order to guarantee their attractiveness and viability.
