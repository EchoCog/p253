# Pattern 040: Integrating The Historical Dimension

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

When a social group or organizational complex is properly balanced it integrates within it traditional groups (or elderly people), appropriately relating them to contemporary groups (or adults) as well as to new kinds of groups (or the young). Failure to do so creates dangerous rifts in the sense of historical continuity and development within the community.
