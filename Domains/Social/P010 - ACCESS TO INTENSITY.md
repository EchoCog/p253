# Pattern 010: Access To Intensity

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Large organizational complexes are experienced as exciting environments because of the variety and intensity of activity within them. But institutional proliferation deprives most people of genuine participation at the foci where action oriented decisions are taken. This problem can only be solved by decentralization around a multitude of smaller decision-making loci, each exemplifying some special way of life corresponding to the needs of the functional domain as a whole.
