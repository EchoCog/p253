# Pattern 013: Sub-Domain Boundary

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

A mosaic of subcultures and alternative life styles requires that hundreds of different groups live, in their own way, at full intensity on neighbouring functional territories. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered by their functional neighbours, if they are functionally separated by functional boundaries, whether traditional or designed.
