# Pattern 014: Identifiable Context

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

People need an identifiable functional unit to belong to (a sector of social space), distinct from other parts of the social environment. Within existing organizational complexes, encourage groups to define the special activity domains with which they are identified. Give them some degree of autonomy and protect them from the high intensity communication pathways of the external environment.
