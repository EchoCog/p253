# Pattern 026: Functional Cycle

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

A well-balanced community, organization, or group is characterized by the presence of a range of distinct activities (some varying correspondingly from the traditional to the innovative), each especially relevant to some phase of the cycle of interacting processes through which the life of a mature group regulates itself and develops. If such activities are not all represented, people can neither fulfil themselves in one phase nor pass successfully on to the next.
