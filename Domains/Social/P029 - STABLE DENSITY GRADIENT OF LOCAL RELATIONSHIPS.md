# Pattern 029: Stable Density Gradient Of Local Relationships

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

In a local or specialized organizational complex people want to be close to the centre "where the action is" and where interpersonal interactions are most intense and challenging. But they must balance this against their need for low key unstructured relationships permitting greater freedom of personal expression and growth. The varying ways in which this balance is struck by individuals in an organization or network defines relationship density rings around the nucleus of the organization. Under the continuing pressure of the arrival of new participants, such a density gradient becomes unstable (to the disadvantage of the less privileged) unless compensatory measures are adopted.
