# Pattern 038: Standard Frameworks

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

In certain parts of an organizational complex clusters of groups (or people) with related preoccupations do not permit sufficiently high relationship densities or degrees of interaction. Standard groups should then be interlinked in chains, such as to provide low intensity communication pathways between them, connecting into higher intensity communication networks. The groups should be interlinked such as to define a common area of concern.
