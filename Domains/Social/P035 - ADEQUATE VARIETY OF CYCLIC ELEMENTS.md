# Pattern 035: Adequate Variety Of Cyclic Elements

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

The mix of people of different ages, namely at different stages in the human life cycle (or the life cycle of a group), is a major factor in determining the degree of coherence and uniqueness of any organizational complex or group. People need support and confirmation from those at other stages in a life cycle, whether older or younger. Mixing different household types must be balanced against the needs for those of the same age group to be together.
