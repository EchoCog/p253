# Pattern 024: Positions Enabling Transcendence

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

In every society, organization complex or local group, there are regularly occurring special occasions transcending day-to-day preoccupations. These become symbols embodying, through some form of ritual, the unique characteristics of the community in question. Unless such occasions are protected, whether they are traditional, religious or improvised, people cannot maintain their spiritual roots and their sense of historical and cultural identity within a more global community.
