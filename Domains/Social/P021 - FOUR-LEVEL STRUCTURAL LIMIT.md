# Pattern 021: Four-Level Structural Limit

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Within any society or organization the number of hierarchical levels (or classes) will vary, with the highest number tending to be towards the centre of any such organizational complex. It is desirable that the majority of organizations, especially those associated with the daily life of a community, should not have more than four such levels. Organizations with more hierarchical levels are destructive of social life, offer few genuine advantages, and are psychologically harmful.
