# Pattern 008: Variety Of Forms And Processes

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

The homogeneous and undifferentiated character of modern organizational complexes and institutional environments inhibits the emergence of alternative life styles and arrests the growth of individual character. By breaking such complexes into a vast mosaic of sub-cultures, each with its own functional territory, the emergence of distinct life styles may be encouraged and protected, provided that each is stimulated and consolidated by an appropriate degree of contact with the others.
