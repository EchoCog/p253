# Pattern 012: Individuality In Multiplicity

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Individuals have no effective voice in any non-territorial community of more than 5,000 to 10,000 persons. Decentralize major institutions in a way that gives local control to functional divisions interrelating approximately 7,000 persons. Use cultural and traditional distinctions to reinforce such organizational boundaries whenever possible. Give each organization the power to initiate, decide and execute the affairs that concern it closely.
