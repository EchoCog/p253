# Pattern 025: Relationship To Indeterminacy

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Informality, whether in the form of parties, festivals or other non-structured occasions providing emotional outlet is of vital and profound significance to people, if only for recreation purposes or to facilitate formal relationships and agreements between organizations. Measures are required to prevent the proliferation of artificial procedures and rituals which render access to informality difficult and disagreeable.
