# Pattern 019: Web Of Selective Interchange

## SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT

Discussion groups, conferences or fairs concerned with similar questions should best be distributed evenly throughout the space-time environment for which they are a process nexus. As such they interact in a self- organizing manner maintaining a stable nexus web despite changes to it resulting from fluctuating demands upon the groupings. Those concerned with different questions can best be located in relationship to the larger groupings in the web.
