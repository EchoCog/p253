# Pattern 031: Cycle Of Relationship Reinforcement

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Within any mode of awareness, linking key perceptual processes together within a larger cyclic process provides a context through which attention is encouraged to move constantly in order to encounter new or alternative insights and the patterns of significance within which they are embedded. Such a cycle renews existing relationships and the integrity of the mode of awareness as a whole.
