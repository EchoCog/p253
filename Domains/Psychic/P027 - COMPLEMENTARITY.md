# Pattern 027: Complementarity

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

In order to successfully comprehend the richness inherent in any mode of awareness, it should be allowed to act in either of two incompatible sub-modes (as typified by those of men and women) understood as permitting complementary perceptions. If a mode of awareness is developed in which one such sub-mode is avoided, the resulting perceptual habits will provide a dangerously oversimplified understanding of reality.
