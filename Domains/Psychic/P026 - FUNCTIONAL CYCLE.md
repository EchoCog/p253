# Pattern 026: Functional Cycle

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

A well-balanced mode of awareness is characterized by a range of distinct perceptions (some varying correspondingly from the habitual to the innovative), each especially relevant to some phase of the cycle of interacting processes through which the person's psychic life is integrated and developed. If such perceptions are not all represented, insights cannot be brought to fruition in one phase by the person nor be successfully transformed for development in subsequent phases.
