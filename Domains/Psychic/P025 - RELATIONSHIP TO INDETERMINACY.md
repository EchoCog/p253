# Pattern 025: Relationship To Indeterminacy

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Unstructured modes of awareness, whether in the form of insight, intuition, empathy or other non- rational forms, is of vital and profound significance to a person, if only as a catalyst for relaxation or to facilitate integration between more disciplined modes of awareness. Measures are required to prevent the proliferation of artificial attitudes and habits which render exposure to such immediate awareness difficult and painful.
