# Pattern 032: Selective Interchange Axis

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

The viability of conditions for the cross-fertilization of personal insights depends on an appropriate compromise between exposure of the individual to a continuing stream of impressions and the possibility for the individual to filter out irrelevant impressions in order to focus awareness on those which remain. This can be achieved by alternating attention, for appropriate periods of time, between the stream of impressions and a focused awareness, thus maintaining continuity of awareness between the two modes.
