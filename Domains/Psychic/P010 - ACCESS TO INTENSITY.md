# Pattern 010: Access To Intensity

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

The principal modes of awareness exert a powerful influence because of the fascinating richness and intensity of experience they provide. But the proliferation of derivative modes of awareness associated with them progressively inhibits direct creative experience of the fundamental insight governing the further transformation of such a mode. This problem can only be solved by multiplying the number of more limited modes of awareness, each exemplifying some more accessible special insight corresponding to the needs of personal development as a whole.
