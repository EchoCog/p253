# Pattern 029: Stable Density Gradient Of Local Relationships

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

In employing a specialized mode of awareness, a balance must be struck between the challenging in- sights to be gained by focusing it in its most intensely disciplined form and the benefit to be derived from allowing it to influence perceptions in a more non-directive manner. The varying ways in which this balance tends to be struck over a period of time by the person using that mode defines density rings of perceptual relationships around the focal awareness. Under the continuing pressure of the emergence of new perceptions, such a gradient becomes unstable (to the disadvantage of some perceptions) unless compensatory measures are adopted.
