# Pattern 006: Intermediate Scale Organization

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Major modes of awareness powerfully attract further involvement. It is consequently difficult for less comprehensive alternative modes of awareness to offer insights of a power sufficient to ensure their viability. Where such alternatives exist they should be preserved. The growth of new alternatives should be encouraged. There should be a general concern to ensure their viability and independence and avoid their development into aspects of any major modes of awareness.
