# Pattern 012: Individuality In Multiplicity

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Individual moments of awareness can have no distinguishably unique function in forming a mode of awareness of more than 5,000 to 10,000 such facets. Modes of awareness should therefore be organized so as to interrelate not more than 7,000 such moments, thus enabling each moment to contribute uniquely to the mode as a whole.
