# Pattern 030: Activity Nodes

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

As a specialized mode of awareness develops, facilitative key insights emerge randomly thus failing to reinforce each other or the integrity of that mode. This may be remedied by consciously associating mutually supportive insights in relation to the principal perceptions (such as those providing a focus for alternative perceptions within that mode) on which the network of insights naturally converge.
