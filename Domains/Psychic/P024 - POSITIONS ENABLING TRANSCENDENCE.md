# Pattern 024: Positions Enabling Transcendence

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Within any mode of awareness there are fundamental or self-reflective insights through which the perceptions in that mode are both integrated and related as a whole to some larger, more fundamental, or transcendent mode of awareness. Unless such key insights are protected, it becomes difficult for the individual to maintain both the coherence of that mode and an understanding of its function within the personality as a whole.
