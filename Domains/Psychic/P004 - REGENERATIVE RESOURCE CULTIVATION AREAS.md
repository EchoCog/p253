# Pattern 004: Regenerative Resource Cultivation Areas

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

The modes of awareness most favourable to regeneration of psychic resources are also those which lend themselves most easily to being structured. The availability of such modes is however limited and once denatured by being structured in this way, their regenerative function cannot easily be recovered. Such modes of awareness should therefore be protected from efforts to structure them.
