# Pattern 047: Functionality Enhancement

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Within any ordinary mode of awareness a significant proportion of the perceptions are unhealthy with respect to the holistic integration of that mode. Such perceptions cannot be effectively improved by focusing directly upon them. A network of facilitative processes is required with integrative potential but providing the opportunity for reflective exercises in the exploration and further development of such perceptions.
