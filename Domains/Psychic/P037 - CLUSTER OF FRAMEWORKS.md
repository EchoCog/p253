# Pattern 037: Cluster Of Frameworks

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

The fundamental unit of local organization in any identifiable field of awareness is the cluster of perceptual frameworks with related foci. The limit on the number of frameworks per cluster varies from 8 to 12 depending on the balance between the fluidity of the perceived relationships and the degree of gestalt awareness of the cluster as a whole. The perceptual frameworks should preferably be configured such as to highlight a unifying awareness.
