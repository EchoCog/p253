# Pattern 023: Compensating Relationships In Parallel

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Even when a person establishes an adequate psychic boundary to unconsciously redirect non-significant incoming perceptions, undesirable confusion may result from the fragmentation of the person's awareness into a network of ad hoc perceptual modes. This may be avoided by developing parallel systems of complementary modes of perceptions as a means of providing continuity of awareness between immediate perceptions and the general patterns of insight within which they emerge.
