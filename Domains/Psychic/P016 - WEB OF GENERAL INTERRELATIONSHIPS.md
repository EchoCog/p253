# Pattern 016: Web Of General Interrelationships

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

An ordered network associating different modes of awareness only acquires its full significance if all modes are integrated within it. This tends not to be the case because of the primacy accorded to certain preferred modes of awareness and the difficulty of integrating modes based on very different insights or extraordinary experiences. This difficulty can be reduced by recognition of integrative correspondences as primary and the insights themselves as secondary. Modes of awareness integrating such correspondences can then require a desirable level of integration of any specialized modes of awareness.
