# Pattern 038: Standard Frameworks

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

In certain areas of a field of awareness clusters of perceptual frameworks do not provide a sufficiently high degree of integration. Standard perceptual frameworks should then be interlinked together (such as in a rote learning or meditation sequence) such as to engender the implicit relationships between them, phasing into the explicit patterns of overall awareness. The frameworks should be interlinked such as to define a shared core of awareness.
