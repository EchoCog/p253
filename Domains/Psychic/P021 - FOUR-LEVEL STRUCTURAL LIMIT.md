# Pattern 021: Four-Level Structural Limit

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

Within any mode of awareness the number of levels of self-reflectiveness, subtlety or degree of apprehension will vary, with the highest number tending to be associated with the core of the person's being. It is desirable that the majority of perceptual modes, especially those required in normal daily life, should not involve more than four such levels. Modes of awareness based on a greater number of levels tend to confuse, offer few genuine advantages, and are psychologically harmful.
