# Pattern 014: Identifiable Context

## INTRA-PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT

An individual needs a central focus to his or her personality (a sector of his or her psychic space) as a reference point for a sense of identity or on which to ground any response to the world. Experiential discovery of such a centre should be encouraged. The sense of relative detachment associated with such a centre should be cultivated and protected from the distractions of external patterns of insight.
