# Pattern 039: Integrating A New Dimension

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

In every urban environment there are places so central that high-rise apartments tend to be constructed to accommodate the high population density. To avoid alienating impersonality, each apartment should have a direct connection to the ground, a private garden and the possibility of acquiring a unique identity. This may be accomplished by using stepped terraces on a housing hill.
