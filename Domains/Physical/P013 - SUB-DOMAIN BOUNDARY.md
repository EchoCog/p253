# Pattern 013: Sub-Domain Boundary

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

A mosaic of subcultures requires that hundreds of different cultures live, in their own way, at full intensity, on neighbouring territories. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered by their territorial neighbours, if they are physically separated by physical boundaries, whether natural or man-made.
