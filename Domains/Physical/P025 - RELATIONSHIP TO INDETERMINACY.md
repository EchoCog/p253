## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Natural bodies of water, whether beaches, lakes or river banks, are of vital and profound significance to people, if only for recreation or industrial purposes. Measures are required to prevent the accumulation of unsightly structures (buildings, factories, roads, etc) at the water's edge which render it inaccessible and disagreeable.
