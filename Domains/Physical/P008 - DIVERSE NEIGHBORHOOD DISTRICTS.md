# Pattern 008: Diverse Neighborhood Districts

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Create neighborhoods that are each distinctive in character, with clear spatial identity, while maintaining overall urban coherence through their diverse architectural and cultural expressions.

Metropolitan areas benefit from a mosaic of distinct neighborhood districts, each with its own architectural character, street patterns, and spatial identity. These districts should be physically distinguishable while contributing to the larger urban fabric. The diversity prevents monotony and creates opportunities for different lifestyles, cultures, and economic activities to flourish in spatially appropriate settings.

**Implementation:**
- Encourage distinct architectural styles and building types in different districts
- Use street patterns, building heights, and open space to define character
- Maintain pedestrian-scaled environments within each district
- Ensure clear physical boundaries between different neighborhood types
