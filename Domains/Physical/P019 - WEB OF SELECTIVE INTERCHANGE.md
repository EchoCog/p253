# Pattern 019: Web Of Selective Interchange

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Shops and other services rarely locate themselves in those positions which both best serve the needs of those they serve and guarantee their own survival. Similar services can best be evenly distributed throughout the area they serve, filling gaps in the web, whilst different services should be located close to the largest cluster of other services.
