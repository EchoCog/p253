# Pattern 008: Variety Of Forms And Processes

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Modern cities are heterogeneous and marked by undifferentiated character which erodes variety of lifestyles and impedes the growth of individuality. By breaking the city, as far as possible, into a vast mosaic of sub-cultures, each with its own spatial territory, the emergence of distinct styles may be encouraged and protected provided that each is stimulated and consolidated by an appropriate degree of contact with the others.
