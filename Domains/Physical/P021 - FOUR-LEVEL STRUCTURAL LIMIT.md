# Pattern 021: Four-Level Structural Limit

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Within any urban area the heights of buildings will vary, with the highest tending to be towards the centre. It is desirable that the majority of buildings, especially those destined for human habitation, should not be more than four stories in height. Higher buildings are destructive of the urban environment, offer few genuine advantages, and are psychologically harmful.
