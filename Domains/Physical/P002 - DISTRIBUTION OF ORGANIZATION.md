# Pattern 002: Distribution Of Organization

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

If the population of a region is comprised of too many small villages, advanced civilization is unlikely to be generated; but if a region has too many large cities, the surrounding area will go to ruin for there will be no populace there to tend to it. The population needs to be distributed evenly in towns of different sizes, and the towns of the same size need to be distributed evenly throughout the region.
