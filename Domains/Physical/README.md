# Physical Environment Patterns

## Description
This folder contains **Christopher Alexander's architectural patterns** adapted for towns, buildings, construction, and spatial organization.

## Purpose
- Address challenges in physical space design and organization
- Guide architectural and urban planning decisions
- Create living, beautiful, and functional physical environments
- Integrate human scale with built environments

## Pattern Structure
Each pattern in this domain describes:
- **Physical Problem**: Specific spatial or architectural challenge
- **Environmental Context**: The physical setting and constraints
- **Spatial Solution**: Concrete design principles and arrangements
- **Implementation Examples**: Real-world applications and cases

## Key Characteristics
- **Spatial focus**: Addresses physical space, form, and function
- **Human scale**: Considers human needs and movement patterns
- **Material concerns**: Deals with construction, geography, and physical constraints
- **Living systems**: Creates environments that support life and activity

## Examples
- Independent regional domains of 2-10 million people
