# Pattern 011: Local Interrelationship Domains

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Automobiles provide unlimited opportunities for freedom and access to variety, but at the expense of both the environment and social life. The urban area should be broken down into local transport areas, each surrounded by a ring road. Within such areas, paths and minor local roads (inconvenient for cars) should be built for internal movement, with major roads providing access to the ring roads.
