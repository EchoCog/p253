# Pattern 029: Stable Density Gradient Of Local Relationships

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

In a local community people want to live close to shops and services for excitement and convenience. They must balance this against the desire to be away from such services in order to experience peace and greenery. The pattern of such choices in a neighbourhood defines density rings around the local centre. Under the continuing pressure of the arrival of new households, such a density gradient becomes unstable (to the disadvantage of the less privileged) unless compensatory measures are adopted.
