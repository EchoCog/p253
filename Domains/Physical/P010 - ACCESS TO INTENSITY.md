# Pattern 010: Access To Intensity

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

City life is experienced as magical because of its intensity. But urban sprawl deprives most people of genuine participation in it because they must live far out from the core. This problem can only be solved by decentralizing the core to form a multitude of smaller cores, each intense and devoted to some special way of life, corresponding to the needs of the region as a whole.
