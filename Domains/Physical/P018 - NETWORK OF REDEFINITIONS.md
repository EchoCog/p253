# Pattern 018: Network Of Redefinitions

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

In a physical environment governed by a fixed plan, the constitutive elements (buildings, traffic, focal points) are perceived as necessarily unchanging in nature. As such they cannot be permitted to contribute to any gradual redefinition of the environment. As such it is difficult to accept that they can contribute to any gradual positive redefinition of the environment through cyclic growth, decay, or adaptation processes. Emergence of new or alternative patterns can only occur when building structures, traffic, etc, adapt to and modify each other's cycles of activity.
