# Pattern 028: Coherent Pattern Of Relationship Densities

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Within an urban environment population densities are higher towards the centre, but there is no recognizable pattern arising from the manner in which this trend is modified by the many component local communities (with their own centres). Such randomness inhibits development of any community identity and creates a chaos in the pattern of land use. Given that the centre of local communities are each located on their community boundary (eccentrically towards the centre of the larger agglomeration), by encouraging them each to bulge both towards the geometric centres of their own local community and in a horseshoe along the neighbouring boundary, a gradient of imbricated horseshoes emerges as an overall pattern supportive of local community life.
