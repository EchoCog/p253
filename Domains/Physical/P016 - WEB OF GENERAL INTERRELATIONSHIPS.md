# Pattern 016: Web Of General Interrelationships

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

The web of different modes of public transportation can only work if all the parts are well-connected. This tends not to be the case because of the emphasis placed on the high volume modes and the difficulty of coordinating the interchange between different modes, especially to local areas. This difficulty can be reduced by treating the interchange points as primary and the actual transportation lines as secondary. Local communities controlling the interchanges can then require guarantees of a desirable level of local service.
