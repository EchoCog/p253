# Pattern 005: Network Of Interrelationships

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Many people want to live in the country whilst also living close to a large city. It is however geometrically impossible to have thousands of small farms within a few minutes of a major city. Both are possible by arranging a loose network of country roads around large open squares of countryside or farmland, with houses closely packed along the road, but only one house deep. In these terms, the suburb is an obsolete and contradictory form of human settlement.
