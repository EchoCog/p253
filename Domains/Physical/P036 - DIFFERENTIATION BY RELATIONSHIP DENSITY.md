# Pattern 036: Differentiation By Relationship Density

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Within any neighbourhood (or cluster of houses) there are those who wish to live close to central services or the movement of people, there are those who prefer privacy, and there are those who prefer some compromise between such extremes. Such differing preferences for publicness may be satisfied by reinforcing the distinction between busy streets, secluded backstreets or pathways, and streets of an intermediate type.
