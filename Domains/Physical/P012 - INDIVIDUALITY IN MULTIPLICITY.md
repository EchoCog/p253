# Pattern 012: Individuality In Multiplicity

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Territorial communities expression than 5000-10,000 persons inhibit individual voices. City governments should be decentralized in such a manner as to give local control to communities of approximately 7,000 persons; these communities being delineated by geographic and historic boundaries. Each community should be individually responsible for initiating, deciding, and executing those affairs by which it is affected.
