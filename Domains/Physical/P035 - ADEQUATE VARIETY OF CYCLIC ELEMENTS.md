# Pattern 035: Adequate Variety Of Cyclic Elements

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

The mix of dwelling types (and ages) in any neighbourhood or urban cluster, namely the presence together of dwellings appropriate for children, single people, working couples, and the old, largely determines the coherence and uniqueness of such a community and its potential for self-renewal. Mixing must be balanced by the need to construct similar dwelling types together.
