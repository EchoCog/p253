# Pattern 026: Functional Cycle

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

A well-balanced village or urban community is characterized by the presence of buildings of a range of types (and ages) each of which facilitates a different activity vital to the integrity of the community. The absence of structures of a particular type (or age) may severely endanger the balance and independence of the community as well as restricting the range of experiences a person can experience there.
