# Pattern 023: Compensating Relationships In Parallel

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Even when ring roads are used to divert through traffic around a local transport area such as a city (or a portion of it), severe congestion results in any network of intersecting streets. This may be avoided by building systems of parallel and alternating one-way roads to carry traffic to and from the ring roads. Cross-streets may be closed to protect neighbourhoods which are defined between the parallel roads if they are an appropriate distance apart (100 to 350 metres).
