# Pattern 007: Non-Linear Organization

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Each region has vast areas of countryside (farmland, parkland, forests, deserts, lakes) which separate towns. The legal and ecological character of this open land is a crucial aspect in the balance of the entire region. parks created in the towns are artificial; farms treated as private property deprive people of their natural rights to enjoy the countryside from whence they came. Every area of open space either is farmed if it is arable or is wardened if it is wild. But the countryside should be open at large to all people, provided they respect the ecological processes going on.
