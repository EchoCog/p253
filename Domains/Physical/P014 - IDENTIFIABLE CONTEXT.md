# Pattern 014: Identifiable Context

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

People need an identifiable spatial unit to belong to (up to 300 yards across; 400-500 inhabitants) distinct from other parts of the urban environment. Today's pattern of development destroys such neighbourhoods. In existing cities, encourage local groups to define physically the neighbourhoods they live in. Give them some degree of autonomy and keep major roads out.
