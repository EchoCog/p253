# Pattern 027: Complementarity

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

In order to ensure appropriate balance within any urban environment, each building, open space, neighbourhood and work community should be developed with a blend of incommensurable insights (as typified by those of men and women). If structures are developed (whether homes, suburbs, supermarkets or factories), in which either of such insights is repressed, such structures perpetuate and solidify the resulting distortion of reality.
