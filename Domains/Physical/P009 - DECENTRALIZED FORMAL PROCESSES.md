# Pattern 009: Decentralized Formal Processes

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

The artificial separation of residential and work environments creates rifts in people's inner lives and prevents the emergence of highly differentiated sub- cultures. The concentration and segregation of work leads to dead neighbourhoods. Zoning and other regulations should be used to scatter workplaces throughout the city and to prohibit large concentrations of family life without associated workplaces.
