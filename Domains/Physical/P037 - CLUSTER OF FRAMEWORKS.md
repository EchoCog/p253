# Pattern 037: Cluster Of Frameworks

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

The fundamental unit of organization within an identifiable neighbourhood is the cluster of houses. The limit on the number of houses per cluster varies from 8 to 12 depending on the balance between the informality and coherence of the group. The houses should preferably be arranged around some commonly owned land and paths.
