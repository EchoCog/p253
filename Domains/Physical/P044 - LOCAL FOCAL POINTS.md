# Pattern 044: Local Focal Points

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

Local government of communities, with the full participation of inhabitants, can best be ensured by provision of a small town hall for each community of about 7000. This should be located near the busiest intersection in the community. It should provide for a public discussion arena, public services, and community project offices.
