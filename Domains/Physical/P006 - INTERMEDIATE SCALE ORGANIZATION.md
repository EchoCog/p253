# Pattern 006: Intermediate Scale Organization

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

The big city is a magnet. Small country towns find it difficult to stay alive and healthy in the face of central urban growth. Where they exist, country towns should be preserved. The growth of new self-contained towns should also be encouraged. The region should be collectively concerned to ensure their viability and avoid their development into dormitory towns.
