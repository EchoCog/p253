# Pattern 030: Activity Nodes

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

As a local community grows, community facilities emerge randomly, thus failing to reinforce each other or the vitality of the community as a whole. This may be remedied by concentrating mutually supportive facilities at activity nodes (such as small public squares distributed evenly throughout the community) on which the network of pathways naturally converge.
