# 5-Fold Pattern Language Domains

This directory contains the five domain-specific pattern languages extracted from the UIA collection, each representing a different environment or context for pattern application.

## The Five Domains

### 1. **Archetypal** Environment
- **Purpose**: Content-free pure relationship patterns
- **Description**: Describes patterns in abstract terms as pure relationships, serving as templates for elaboration in other domains
- **Focus**: Universal structural principles that transcend specific contexts

### 2. **Physical** Environment  
- **Purpose**: Alexander's architectural and spatial patterns
- **Description**: Original Christopher Alexander patterns adapted for towns, buildings, and construction
- **Focus**: Spatial organization, architecture, urban planning, and physical environments

### 3. **Social** Environment
- **Purpose**: Social groups, organizations, and networks
- **Description**: Patterns applied to social organization, communities, institutions, and human networks
- **Focus**: Organizational structure, group dynamics, social systems, and collective behavior

### 4. **Conceptual** Environment
- **Purpose**: Conceptual frameworks and knowledge organization  
- **Description**: Patterns for organizing ideas, knowledge systems, and intellectual frameworks
- **Focus**: Information structure, conceptual relationships, learning systems, and knowledge management

### 5. **Intra-Personal** Environment
- **Purpose**: Modes of awareness and personal organization
- **Description**: Patterns for organizing individual consciousness, mental processes, and personal development
- **Focus**: Psychological structure, awareness modes, personal growth, and inner organization

## Pattern Structure

Each domain contains the same fundamental patterns but adapted to its specific context, maintaining the underlying relational structure while expressing it in domain-appropriate language and examples.
