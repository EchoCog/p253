# 5-Fold Pattern Language Domains

This directory contains the five domain-specific pattern languages extracted from the UIA collection, each representing a different environment or context for pattern application. **Each domain now contains comprehensive indexes with all 253 Alexander Pattern Language patterns translated into domain-appropriate terminology.**

## ‚ú® Recent Updates

**Comprehensive Domain Indexes Created**: All five domains now feature complete pattern indexes with all 253 patterns from Christopher Alexander's *A Pattern Language* translated into contextually appropriate terminology while preserving the underlying relational structure.

## The Five Domains

### 1. **Archetypal** Environment
- **Purpose**: Content-free pure relationship patterns
- **Description**: Describes patterns in abstract terms as pure relationships, serving as templates for elaboration in other domains
- **Focus**: Universal structural principles that transcend specific contexts
- **Coverage**: 253 patterns using abstract relational terminology
- **[üìã Pattern Index](Archetypal/INDEX.md)** | **[üìÅ Browse Patterns](Archetypal/)**

### 2. **Physical** Environment  
- **Purpose**: Alexander's architectural and spatial patterns
- **Description**: Original Christopher Alexander patterns adapted for towns, buildings, and construction
- **Focus**: Spatial organization, architecture, urban planning, and physical environments
- **Coverage**: 253 patterns using architectural and spatial terminology
- **[üìã Pattern Index](Physical/INDEX.md)** | **[üìÅ Browse Patterns](Physical/)**

### 3. **Social** Environment
- **Purpose**: Social groups, organizations, and networks
- **Description**: Patterns applied to social organization, communities, institutions, and human networks
- **Focus**: Organizational structure, group dynamics, social systems, and collective behavior
- **Coverage**: 253 patterns using organizational and community terminology
- **[üìã Pattern Index](Social/INDEX.md)** | **[üìÅ Browse Patterns](Social/)**

### 4. **Conceptual** Environment
- **Purpose**: Conceptual frameworks and knowledge organization  
- **Description**: Patterns for organizing ideas, knowledge systems, and intellectual frameworks
- **Focus**: Information structure, conceptual relationships, learning systems, and knowledge management
- **Coverage**: 253 patterns using knowledge and information terminology
- **[üìã Pattern Index](Conceptual/INDEX.md)** | **[üìÅ Browse Patterns](Conceptual/)**

### 5. **Intra-Personal** Environment
- **Purpose**: Modes of awareness and personal organization
- **Description**: Patterns for organizing individual consciousness, mental processes, and personal development
- **Focus**: Psychological structure, awareness modes, personal growth, and inner organization
- **Coverage**: 253 patterns using psychological and consciousness terminology
- **[üìã Pattern Index](Psychic/INDEX.md)** | **[üìÅ Browse Patterns](Psychic/)**

## Pattern Structure

Each domain contains the same fundamental 253 patterns but adapted to its specific context, maintaining the underlying relational structure while expressing it in domain-appropriate language and examples.

### Translation Examples

| APL Original | Physical | Social | Conceptual | Archetypal | Intra-Personal |
