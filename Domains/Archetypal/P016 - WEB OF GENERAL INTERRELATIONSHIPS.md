# Pattern 016: Web Of General Interrelationships

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

A general system of interrelationships can only work if all the parts are well-connected. This tends not to be the case because of the privileged role accorded to the major relationships and the difficulty of linking relationships of different kinds. This difficulty can be reduced by treating the interrelationship nodes as primary and the interrelationship links as secondary.
