# Pattern 003: Interpretation Of Complementary Modes Of Organization

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

A continuous pattern of organization and definition denies the existence and emergence of the underdefined and severely diminishes the value of major established patterns of organization. But the degree of integration of such major patterns is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring appropriate interpenetration of defined and underdefined modes of organization as complements.
