# Pattern 018: Network Of Redefinitions

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

In a context in which a particular form of order is self-reinforcing at all points, the elements constituting that order do not contribute to the redefinition of it or to the emergence of any new pattern. Such pattern emergences occur when the elements are able progressively to redefine their relationship to each other in the light of their past patterning experience.
