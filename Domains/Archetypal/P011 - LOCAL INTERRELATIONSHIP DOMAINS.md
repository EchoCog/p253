# Pattern 011: Local Interrelationship Domains

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

Means of non-local interrelationship, when employed locally, inhibit the articulation of local domains and destroy their integrity. The domain as a whole should be broken down into local interrelationship domains for which the non-local interrelationships help to define a boundary. Appropriate connections should be established between the local and non-local interrelationships.
