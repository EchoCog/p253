# Pattern 004: Regenerative Resource Cultivation Areas

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

Those areas in which resources can best be regenerated are also those most favourable for the construction of frameworks. The availability of such areas is however limited and once denatured by the construction of frameworks, its resource regeneration function cannot easily be recovered. Such areas should therefore be protected.
