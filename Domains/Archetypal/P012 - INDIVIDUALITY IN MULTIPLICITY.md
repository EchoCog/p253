# Pattern 012: Individuality In Multiplicity

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

Individual elements, as such, can have no distinguishably unique function in forming a pattern composed of 5,000 to 10,000 such elements. Patterns should therefore be decentralized so as to group not more than approximately 7,000 such elements, thus enabling each element to play a distinct part in the pattern.
