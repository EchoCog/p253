# Pattern 024: Positions Enabling Transcendence

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

In any domain there are points which provide a focus for the relationships between other points. Such a focal point or "centre of gravity" serves an integrative function through which the domain may both itself be integrated as well as being related as a whole to frameworks which transcend the boundary of the domain.
