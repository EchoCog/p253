# Pattern 029: Stable Density Gradient Of Local Relationships

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

The locus of formation of new local relationships is determined by a balance between proximity to the local centre (as an attraction) and distance from the intensity of processes there (acting as a repellent). The varying ways in which this balance is determined leads to the emergence of rings of different relationship density (a density gradient) around the local centre. This density configuration will be unstable unless measures are adopted to compensate for the instability resulting from continuing pressure to form further relationships at preferred locations.
