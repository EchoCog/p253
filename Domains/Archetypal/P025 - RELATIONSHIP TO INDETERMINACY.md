# Pattern 025: Relationship To Indeterminacy

## ARCHETYPAL ENVIRONMENT

The significance of a domain of defined relationships is enhanced if it includes, or is contiguous with, a domain of indeterminacy in which fixed relationships are partially freed to form other patterns. The boundary between the two domains requires special protection because of the tendency of unharmonious relationships to accumulate there in an uncontrolled manner.
