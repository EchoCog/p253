# Pattern 012: Individuality In Multiplicity

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Individual concepts can have no distinguishably unique function in constituting a conceptual framework of more than 5,000 to 10,000 such concepts. Conceptual frameworks should therefore be partitioned so as to interrelate not more than 7,000 such concepts, thus enabling each concept to fulfil a distinct role in the pattern.
