# Pattern 037: Cluster Of Frameworks

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

The fundamental unit of local organization in any identifiable conceptual span is the (proximity) cluster of conceptual frameworks with related foci. The limit on the number of frameworks per cluster varies from 8 to 12 depending on the balance between the network of implicit, associative relationships and the degree of explicit, structural organization. The relationships between the frameworks should preferably be such as to define a common focus.
