# Pattern 025: Relationship To Indeterminacy

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Indeterminacy, whether in the form of uncertainty, fuzziness, or ignorance, is of vital and profound importance to creative conceptual development, if only to facilitate the emergence of alternative perspectives or to enable beneficial cross-fertilization between conceptual frameworks. Measures are required to prevent the proliferation of artificial methods and procedures which render exposure to uncertainty difficult and conceptually inelegant.
