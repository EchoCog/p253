# Pattern 032: Selective Interchange Axis

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

The viability of environments for the cross-fertilization of ideas between different frames of reference or schools of thought (such as in knowledge representation systems) depends on an appropriate compromise between their accessibility through structured high speed information systems and the extended time period required to reflect on new ideas. This can be achieved by connecting local (or personal) information systems enhancing cross-fertilization to different data networks.
