# Pattern 013: Sub-Domain Boundary

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

A mosaic of subcultures and conceptual frameworks requires that hundreds of different schools of thought function, in their own way, at full intensity on neighbouring conceptual domains. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered by their intellectual neighbours, if they are conceptually separated by definitions, whether traditional or designed.
