# Pattern 034: Interchange

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

The focal, or interdisciplinary, concepts which provide interconnections between different lines of thought, play a central role in ensuring the viability and integrity of the web of conceptual relationships. Such nexuses of inter-relationships should be organized to make them relevant to ideas emanating from different schools of thought and to minimize the discontinuity between different modes of thought.
