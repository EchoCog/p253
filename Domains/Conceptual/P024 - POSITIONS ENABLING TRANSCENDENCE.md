# Pattern 024: Positions Enabling Transcendence

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

In any conceptual domain there are key, focal, or self-reflective concepts which serve an integrative function whereby the domain may both itself be integrated as well as being related as a whole to more fundamental or meta-frameworks transcending the boundary of the domain. Unless such focal concepts are protected, it becomes difficult to maintain both the cohesion of the domain and its relevance within any larger conceptual framework.
