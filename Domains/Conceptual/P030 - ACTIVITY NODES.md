# Pattern 030: Activity Nodes

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

As a specialized conceptual domain develops, facilitative methods emerge randomly, thus failing to reinforce each other or the interest of the domain as a whole. This may be remedied by deliberately grouping mutually supportive methods in relation to the key concepts (such as those providing a focus for alternative perspectives within the domain) on which the network or conceptual relationships naturally converge.
