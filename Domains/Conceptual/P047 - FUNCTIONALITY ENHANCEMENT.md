# Pattern 047: Functionality Enhancement

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

In any ordinary conceptual environment or school of thought a significant proportion of the conceptual portions or processes exhibit dysfunctional characteristics in terms of the integration of the domain as a whole. These cannot be effectively remedied by focusing directly upon them. A network of facilitative conceptual environments is required with consultative expertise but providing the opportunity for creative exercises in the exploration and further development of such positions.
