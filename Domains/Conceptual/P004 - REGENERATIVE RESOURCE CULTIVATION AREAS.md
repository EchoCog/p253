# Pattern 004: Regenerative Resource Cultivation Areas

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

The domains most favourable to regeneration of creative resources are also those in which concepts can most easily be ordered into conceptual frameworks. The availability of such areas is however limited and once denatured by the establishment of such frameworks their function in regenerating creative resources cannot easily be recovered. Such creative domains should therefore be protected from attempts at conceptual organization.
