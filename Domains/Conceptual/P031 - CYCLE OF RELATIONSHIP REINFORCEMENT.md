# Pattern 031: Cycle Of Relationship Reinforcement

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

In any conceptual domain or school of thought, linking together the key foci of conceptual activity in a cycle of conceptual processes provides an environment through which ideas are encouraged to move constantly in order to be challenged by new or alternative insights and the associated conceptual relationships. Such a cycle reinforces existing relationships and the integrity of that body of knowledge as a whole.
