# Pattern 046: Diversified Interchange Environment

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

A framework for the interchange of ideas is most effective and dynamic when it offers a wide variety of methods, approaches and procedures, rather than being based on a single all-embracing approach. Only a minimum framework defining the relationship between the approaches is required, together with any common facilitative procedures.
