# Pattern 038: Standard Frameworks

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

In certain parts of a conceptual domain loose clusters of conceptual frameworks do not permit a sufficiently high degree of integration. Standard frameworks (such as matrices of concepts) should then be interlinked by a sequence of procedures such as to encourage non-linear interactions between them, phasing into the linear pattern of more general relationships. The frameworks should be interlinked such as to define a shared common focus.
