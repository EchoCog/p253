# Pattern 008: Variety Of Forms And Processes

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

The homogeneous and undifferentiated character of major schools of thought or ideological frameworks inhibits the emergence of alternative conceptual styles deviating from the norm, thus arresting conceptual development. By fragmenting such frameworks into a vast mosaic of sub-cultures, each with its own specialized domain and sharply delineated values, the emergence of distinct intellectual styles may be encouraged and protected, provided that each is stimulated and consolidated by an appropriate degree of contact with the others.
