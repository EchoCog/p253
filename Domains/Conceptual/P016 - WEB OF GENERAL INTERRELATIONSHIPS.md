# Pattern 016: Web Of General Interrelationships

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

The web of general conceptual relationships only acquires its full significance if all concepts are integrated within it. This tends not to be the case because of the fundamental role attributed to intellectual or ideological lines of thought, and the difficulty of integrating concepts based on very different or highly specialized modes of thought. This difficulty can be reduced by treating such interrelationship nexi as primary and the relationships themselves as secondary. Concepts governing such nexi can then require a desirable level of integration of specialized modes of thought.
