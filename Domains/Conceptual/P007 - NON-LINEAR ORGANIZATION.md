# Pattern 007: Non-Linear Organization

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Within each conceptual domain there are extensive areas of non-linear organization of knowledge providing a context for those areas which have been linearly organized. Such non-linear organization is crucial to the balance of knowledge in the domain and as such should be accessible to all, with due respect for the special quality of the conceptual processes involved.
