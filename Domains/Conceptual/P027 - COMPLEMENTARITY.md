# Pattern 027: Complementarity

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

In order to successfully embody the complexity inherent in any conceptual domain, each framework should be articulated with a combination of incommensurable perspectives (as typified by those of men and women) viewed as a complementary set of descriptions. If a conceptual framework is developed in which one such perspective is ignored, such a framework perpetuates and gives form to the resulting oversimplified representations of reality.
