# Pattern 010: Access To Intensity

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Major schools of thought, conceptual frameworks or ideologies are a powerful attractant because of the intensity and complexity of intellectual activity associated with them. But the proliferation of derivative conceptual developments associated with them progressively deprives most people of genuine participation at those points of excellence where creative development is actually taking place. This problem can only be solved by decentralization around a multitude of smaller innovative areas, each exemplifying some special method or approach corresponding to the needs of the conceptual domain as a whole.
