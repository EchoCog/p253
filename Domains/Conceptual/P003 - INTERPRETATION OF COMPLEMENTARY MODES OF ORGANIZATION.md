The proliferation of totally organized bodies of knowledge and conceptual methods ignores the existence and emergence of underdefined concepts and forms of integration with the consequence that conceptual development is severely inhibited. But the degree of integration of such established bodies of knowledge is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring the interpenetration of formal and informal modes of conceptual organization.
