# Pattern 006: Intermediate Scale Organization

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Major conceptual and ideological frameworks powerfully attract adherents. It is consequently difficult for smaller alternative frameworks to offer knowledge of equivalent interest to ensure their viability. Where such alternatives exist they should be preserved. The growth of new alternatives should be encouraged. There should be collective concern within the conceptual domain to ensure their viability and avoid their development into conceptual outposts of any major framework.
