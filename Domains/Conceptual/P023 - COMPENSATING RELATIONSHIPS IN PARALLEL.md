# Pattern 023: Compensating Relationships In Parallel

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Even when a clearly defined contextual pattern of general concepts is used to filter out irrelevant concepts (which may destroy the integrity of a conceptual domain) confusion may result locally from the proliferation of unordered networks of conceptual relationships thus inhibiting the further development of that domain. This may be avoided by developing alternative systems of assymetric or complementary relationships in parallel as a means of linking locally elaborated concepts into the wider network of general conceptual relationships.
