# Pattern 002: Distribution Of Organization

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

If a conceptual domain is characterized by small networks or groups of concepts to too great an extent, more integrated and comprehensive forms of organization cannot emerge. But if such a domain is characterized by extensively organized networks of concepts to too great an extent, such a degree of organization will prove detrimental to the integrity of the conceptual domain. Bodies of knowledge of different degrees of organization should be distributed evenly throughout the domain.
