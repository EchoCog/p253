# Pattern 014: Identifiable Context

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

People need an identifiable belief system or school of thought to belong to (a sector of conceptual space), distinct from other parts of the conceptual environment. Within existing conceptual frameworks, encourage groups to define the areas of special interest with which they are identified. Give them some degree of autonomy and protect them from being overridden by patterns of general relationships.
