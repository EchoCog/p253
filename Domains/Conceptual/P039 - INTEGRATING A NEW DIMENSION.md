# Pattern 039: Integrating A New Dimension

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

At the central foci of any conceptual domain the necessary density of relationships between concepts is such as to require that many be based on a new (or meta) dimension. To avoid arid incomprehensibility, each set of concepts should maintain a direct connection to simpler and more fundamental patterns of relationship, whilst at the same time acquiring unique characteristics within the new framework.
