# Pattern 026: Functional Cycle

## CONCEPTUAL ENVIRONMENT

A well-balanced conceptual domain or body of knowledge is characterized by a range of distinct methods or conceptual approaches (some varying correspondingly from the traditional to the innovative), each especially relevant to some phase of the cycle of interacting processes through which the life of a mature school of thought regulates itself and develops. If such approaches are not all represented, ideas cannot be brought to fruition in one phase nor be successfully transformed for development in subsequent phases.
