[103 Small Parking Lots\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl103.htm)

Fix the position of individual buildings on the site, within the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important moments in the language.

[109 Long Thin House\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl109.htm)

Within the buildings' wings, lay out the entrances, the gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of fhe buildings and the volume of the space between the buildings at the same time-remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, Yin and Yang, must always get their shape together;

[110 Main Entrance\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl110.htm)

[111 Half-Hidden Garden](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl111.htm)

[118 Roof Garden\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl118.htm)

When the major parts of buildings and the outdoor areas have been given their rough shape, it is the right time to give more detailed attention to the paths and squares between the buildings

[119 Arcades\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl119.htm)

[120 Paths And Goals\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl120.htm)

[126 Something Roughly In The Middle](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl126.htm)

Now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the buildings: within the various wings of any one building, work out the fundamental gradients of space, and decide how the movement will connect the spaces in the gradients;

[135 Tapestry Of Light And Dark\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl135.htm)

Within the framework of the wings and their internal gradients of space and movement, define the most important areas and rooms. First, for a house;
