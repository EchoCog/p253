### Pattern template

Space is partly defined by the particular perspectives of those present. Uniform exposure of a space to awareness serves no useful purpose whatsoever. It destroys the social significance of space and leads to a sense of disorientation and unboundedness.

**Physical** Pools of light defining a dappled environment, in contrast to unnatural uniform illumination as typified by many modern offices.

**Social** Domains of shared preoccupation, in contrast to a single general concern which undermines the cohesiveness of distinct groups and prevents them from coming into any meaningful form of existence.

**Conceptual** Domains of special insights or foci of attention, in contrast to an overriding general awareness which inhibits the development of a variety of specialized conceptual skills.

**Psychic** Modes of personal insights, in contrast to an overriding general awareness or monopolarization such as to inhibit the development of a variety of particular conditions of awareness.
