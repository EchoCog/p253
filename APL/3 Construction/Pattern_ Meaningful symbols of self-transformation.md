### Pattern template

A space can best be given further definition by associating with it a set of meaningful, self-chosen symbols that have a catalytic power in the continuous process of self-transformation (possibly as an outward counterpart to the unconscious). This function will be inadequately fulfilled by using symbols recommended by external specialists.

**Physical** Things from one's own life (e.g. pictures, objects), as opposed to the recommendations of interior decorators.

**Social** Special rituals and behaviour patterns embodying meaningful moments in the history of the integration of the group, as opposed to rituals recommended or imposed by well-intentioned outsiders.

**Conceptual** Special concepts or code words which have helped to define the unique flavour of the particular language or mode of communication used.

**Psychic** Personal memories and associations, as opposed to those obtained or imposed via the media.

**Broader** [Symbols of integration](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1249.php); [Accessible facilities for perspective adjuncts](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1201.php); [Relatively isolated context for each perspective](https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs80s/pattern/p1141.php).
