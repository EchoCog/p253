[[001 Independent Regions]]
[001. Independent Regions\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl001.htm)

Within each region work toward those regional policies which will protect the land and mark the limits of the cities:

[[002 The Distribution Of Towns]]

Through city policies, encourage the piecemeal formation of those major structures which define the city:

[8\. Mosaic of Subcultures\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl008.htm)

[9\. Scattered Work\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl009.htm)

[10\. Magic of the City](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl010.htm)

[11\. Local Transport Areas\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl011.htm)

Build up these larger city patterns from the grass roots, through action essentially controlled by two levels of self-governing communities, which exist as physically identifiable places

[12\. Community of 7000\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl012.htm)

[13\. Subculture Boundary\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl013.htm)

[14 Identifiable Neighborhood\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl014.htm)

[15 Neighborhood Boundary\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl015.htm)

Connect communities to one another by encouraging the growth of the following networks:

[16 Web of Public Transportation\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl016.htm)

[17 Ring Roads](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl017.htm)

[18 Network Of Learning\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl018.htm)

[20 Mini-Buses\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl020.htm)

Establish community and neighborhood policy to control the character of the local environment according to the following fundamental principles;

[21 Four-Story Limit\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl021.htm)

[22 Nine Per Cent Parking\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl022.htm)

[26 Life Cycle\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl026.htm)

[27 Men And Women](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl027.htm)

Both in the neighborhoods and the communities, and in between them, in the boundaries, encourage the formation of local centers;

[28 Eccentric Nucleus\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl028.htm)

[34 Interchange](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl034.htm)

Around these centers, provide for the growth of housing in the form of clusters, based on face-to-face human groups;

[35 Househould Mix\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl035.htm)

[36 Degrees Of Publicness\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl036.htm)

[40 Old People Everywhere\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl040.htm)

[48 Housing In Between\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl048.htm)

[66 Holy Ground\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl066.htm)

In each house cluster and work community, provide the smaller bits of common land, to provide for local versions of the same needs

[67 Common Land\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl067.htm)

[68 Connected Play\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl068.htm)

[74 Animals](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl074.htm)

Within the framework of the common land, the clusters, and the work communities encourage transformation of the smallest independent social institutions: the families, workgroups, and gathering places. The family, in all its forms;

[75 The Family\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl075.htm)
